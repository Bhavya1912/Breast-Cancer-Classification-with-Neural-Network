# Breast-Cancer-Classification-with-Neural-Network
Breast Cancer Classification using Neural Network in Python. This is the first Deep Learning Project in our channel. Here we build a simple Neural Network (NN) with Tensorflow and Keras in Python.

This repository contains a project that uses a neural network to classify breast cancer as either malignant or benign based on a dataset of features extracted from breast mass images. The project was created as part of a machine learning course and serves as an example of using neural networks for classification tasks.

Dependencies
The project was implemented using Python 3.7 and the following libraries:

NumPy
pandas
scikit-learn
Keras
